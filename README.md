# paging-sample-tutorial

This is a sample for implementing paging3. Main project goal is for practicing paging3 in detail from scratch to struggle with its difficulties.

Libraries I used were *Paging3* for get data by page, *Hilt* for injections, *Retrofit* for getting data from the net, *navigation component* for single activity approach and *Glide* for showing image in UI.

The API is from [this blog](http://moviesapi.ir/) thanks to Abbas Ovveisi.
